							<li>Lifting/Exercise</li>
								<p>Fitness is very important to me. I am someone who is very keen on self-improvement, and I appreciate that the effort I put into this hobby has visible results.</p>
							<li>Anime</li>
								<p>We all need an escape from reality once in a while, and anime is my favorite outlet for that. I don't think that I can count how many Animes I've watched; there are just too many!</p>
							<li>Video Games</li>
								<p>For me, gaming has always been a very enjoyable pastime. Not only does it stimulate my interest in tech, it has allowed me to keep in touch with friends through the pandemic.</p>
							<li>PC Building</li>
								<p>As PC gaming has gradually become a much larger niche over the years, I was interested in getting into the hobby of PC building. As a result, I taught myself how to build my own computer. I've built one for my dad, and have been helping my friends out with their builds as well.</p>
