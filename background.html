							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/la.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I am currently pursuing my undergraduate studies in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the esteemed University of California, Berkeley. As a first-generation college student, I am incredibly proud to be paving the way for future generations of my family.

								Growing up in the city of Watts, located in South Central Los Angeles, I witnessed firsthand the scarcity of educational opportunities available in my community. To counter this, I attended schools in the Long Beach area. Despite the challenges posed by the high crime rates in my neighborhood, I remained steadfast in my pursuit of knowledge and personal growth.
								
								Throughout my childhood, my passion for technology flourished. Whether it was coding projects, video games, or building computers, I was always drawn to the tech sphere. These interests were not just a means of passing the time but an integral part of my identity.
								
								For a deeper glimpse into my multifaceted personality, please feel free to peruse the rest of my page. Thank you for taking the time to learn about me.</p>
