							<li>Lifting/Exercise</li>
								<p>Fitness is very important to me. I am someone who is very keen on self-improvement, and I appreciate that the effort I put into this hobby has visible results.</p>
							<li>Fashion</li>
								<p>I find that fashion is a great outlet for me to express myself and showcase my unique personality through my clothing choices. Not only does it allow me to have fun with my personal style, but it also positively impacts my mental health by boosting my confidence and self worth.</p>
							<li>Music</li>
								<p>Music has been a valuable source of connection for me, both through my enjoyment of listening to various genres and my own creative expression in producing it. It allows me to connect with others who share similar musical interests and expand my own musical horizons by exploring new and diverse styles.	</p>
							<li>PC Building</li>
								<p>As PC gaming has gradually become a much larger niche over the years, I was interested in getting into the hobby of PC building. As a result, I taught myself how to build my own computer. I've built one for my dad, and have been helping my friends out with their builds as well.</p>
